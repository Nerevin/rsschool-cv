## About me:
  
> My goal is to change my profession, now I work as a design engineer at a large enterprise, but there are few opportunities for self-realization.   
> I believe that work in the IT sector allows you to monitor new technologies and constantly develop. I believe that I have a good self-learning skill,  
> I take responsibility for tasks and always try to get to the bottom of the matter, and I also love computers from an early age.
